## Frontend Module Design

     - Login page header
     - User page header
     - Admin page header  
   - Usage
      1. write `import { NavigationBar } from './Navbar.js';` at the beginning of the file to import the Header module
      2. write `<NavigationBar page='login' />`, `<NavigationBar page='user' />`, `<NavigationBar page='admin' />` like a basic HTML element in the return part. The codes are for login, user, and admin respectively.

   - Usage  
     1. write `import { TweetCard } from './TweetCard'` at the beginning of the file to import the Tweet Card module
     2. Store JSON data to `tweet_data`, data structure should be stored like below
        ```javascript
        const tweet_data = {
            avatarUrl: './avatar.png',
            username: 'Gavin OP',
            tweetId: '100056',
            likeStatus: 1,
            dislikeStatus: 0,
            starStatus: 1,
            likeCount: 49,

        };
        ```
     3. write `<TweetCard {...tweet_data} />` like a basic HTML element in the return part. 
   - Required JSON data from the server should be the structure below
     ```javascript
     {
         avatarUrl: './avatar.png',

     - Normal post page (allows pictures uploading)
     - Retweet post page (Uses `<TweetCard />` component)     
   - Usage: Just use `<Post  />`

6. Tweet Detail and Retweet Detail    
      - Features: Tweet content display, comment input, comments display.
      - People in Charge: GZH
      - Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê
      - Note: 
        - Since we don't have a limit for the number of pictures now, we should set this limit to 2 or 3 in future.
        - Normal post doesn't have tweet_data, retweet post doesn't have imageSrc.
      - Usage: Just use `<Tweetpage />`. No input now, we may use `<Tweetpage file={file}} />` later (need to change the file).
         ```javascript
        let test_file = {
           username: 'David',
           avatar: "./avatar2.png",
           time: '2023-3-7 0:04',
           tweetId: 9978,
           content: "A test twitter: aobtb abyaaotbaotbao btap tnap tpiabt pabtapit bata tat ",
           favos: 2,
           likes: 9,
           comments: [{user:'user1', avatar:"./avatar.png", content:'Comment 1', time:'2023-3-21 19:00'},

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
